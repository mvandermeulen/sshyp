## Installation (Haiku)
**Missing features:** For security and technical reasons, the Haiku version of sshyp cannot be used as a server (it only functions as a client). Additionally, the Haiku package does not support the extension management system, so extensions still must be installed as separate packages.

Please note that sshyp for Haiku is targeting release R1 Beta 4 (64-bit). Previous releases have significant show-stopping bugs, while stability on the nightly releases cannot be guaranteed.
***
1. Download the *.hpkg file from the [latest tagged release of sshyp](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp/releases)

2. Open the downloaded file and click "Install sshyp" in the top right of the window

   **or**

   Run `pkgman install <path/to/*.hpkg>`

3. sshyp is now installed - run `sshyp init` to get started!
