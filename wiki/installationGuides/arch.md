## Installation (Arch Linux)
The Arch package is actively tested on up-to-date installations of Arch and Artix Linux.
***
The easiest method of installation is via the AUR. Search for "sshyp" using your favorite AUR helper or run:
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/sshyp.git
cd sshyp
makepkg -si
```
sshyp is now installed - run `sshyp init` to get started!
