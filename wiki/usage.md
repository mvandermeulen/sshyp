## Usage
**Note:** [Shell completions may require additional configuration to work](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp/blob/main/wiki/completions.md).

Read the man page with `man sshyp`, or [preview it on GitHub](https://github.com/rwinkhart/sshyp/blob/main/extra/manpage).

Please note that the version of the man page on GitHub may not be accurate to the version of sshyp you have installed, as the git version is kept up to date with the source, rather than the latest tagged release.
