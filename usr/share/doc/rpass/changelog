rpass-2021.09.08.pr4

The Housekeeping Update (Pt. 1) - Fourth public release of rpass

This release focuses primarily on polishing rpass and tying up loose ends before
making any major changes in the future.

New features:

**overhaul error messages using exceptions
**add exceptions for unknown arguments
**make clean, colorful file list by exporting to document and removing extensions
**make a manpage
**multi-line notes?

Changes:

- fixed gpg decryption warnings
- added version info argument
- re-ordered config wizard for better rsync support
**optimize code (specifically for when there is no folder but there is a slash)
**fix rsync delete on upload
**properly comment the code
**validate for Python 3.10
**do a better job at clearing /dev/shm

Planned for next update (The Secret Update):

- allow to function as alternative to gnome keyring (libsecret integration)

Planned, no timeline:

- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first linux phones, maybe android at a later date - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add windows support and package for more Linux distributions)
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)

rpass 2021.09.07.pr3.1

The Sync and Foundations Update - Hotfix

Changes:

- gpg configuration now prompts for expiration, rather than defaulting to two years
- rsync is now configured to not delete anything from any remote device when uploading
    ^ this behavior may be modified in the future - this is a quick fix to prevent data loss
