sshyp 2021.11.12.fr2

The Lighter Update

This release features a major re-write of old "rpass" code.
sshyp is now more reliable and better documented.

New features:

- an almost full re-write of the old "rpass" code used in the last release
    ^ includes more reliable argument parsing and various optimizations
- new folders are now also created on the server
**fix gen command using old notes system
** address TODO comments

Changes:

** major sshync bugs fixed
    ^fixed many instances where sshync would refuse to upload/download
    ^fixed errors that were being thrown despite sshync working as intended
** updated and optimized code for sshync
    ^f-strings, address TODO comments

Planned for next update (The Fluffier Update):

- new visual features
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art. sshyp will be
    getting a retro computing theme.
- packages for more environments
    ^ "sshyp" will be officially packaged for Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, and Termux (Android).
    Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora packaging will come later.
- imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
- fix nested folders

Planned for next, next update (The Shears Update Pt. 1):

- allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
- allow for multi-client deletion... somehow
- detatch sshync and make it a separate package
- manpage

Planned for next, next, next update (The Shears Update Pt. 2):

- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)

Backlog:

- package for more Linux distributions, such as Debian and Fedora
- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile and desktop Linux

sshyp 2021.11.05.fr1

First public release of sshyp.

This release fixes major bugs from rpass and rebrands the project.

New features:

- an entirely new syncing back-end called sshync (custom Python wrapper around sftp)
    ^ in thoery, all syncing-related data loss should now be fixed, however, this new
    system has just been created and is still under testing. Maybe wait for a few patches
    before trusting this system.

Changes:

- branding has been updated to reflect new project name and goals
- custom directories, custom ssh keys, and offline only mode are removed (may be temporary)
    ^ the configuration wizard is being re-written in the next major update

Planned for next update (The Fluffy Update):

- modularized and optimized code
    ^ some older, bad code from "rpass" will be re-written.
- new visual features
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art. sshyp will be
    getting a retro computing theme.
- packages for more environments
    ^ "sshyp" will be officially packaged for Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, and Termux (Android).
    Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora packaging will come later.

Planned for next update (The Sheep w/Shears Update):

- allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
- allow for multi-client deletion... somehow
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- detatch sshync and make it a separate package
- manpage

Planned, no timeline:

- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (Android + Linux phones)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- package for more Linux distributions, such as Debian and Fedora)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)

rpass 2021.11.01.mr5.1

The Notetaker Update - Patch 1

This is the FINAL release of "rpass".
After this release, the project will be rebranded as "sshyp".

rpass's syncing system is fundamentally broken, hence the need for "sshyp"
and its new syncing system. I would highly advise against using this release.

New features:

- none

Changes:

- fixed an issue with copying notes (currently only copies first line, will be changed in the future)
- rpass is validated to work with Python 3.10 (no changes were needed)

Planned for next update (sshyp fr1)

- full project rebrand ("sshyp")
- new syncing back-end

rpass 2021.10.07.mr5

The Notetaker Update - Fifth main release of rpass

This release overhauls the note-taking system and provides general improvements
to overall code quality, including optimizations, bug fixes, and security improvements.

New features:

- notes are now edited in nano and can be split across multiple lines
- password confirmation has been added for entry deletion

Changes:

- fixed issues with copying passwords with certain special characters, e.g. '"()|
- auto-generated ssh key now uses ed25519, rather than rsa-3072
- entry format modified to include a blank line before the notes field (old format still mostly compatible)
- rpass is now much better at catching bad arguments
- some general code cleanup

Planned for next update (The Housekeeping Update Pt. 2):

- add new file list w/color and w/o extensions + proper displaying of nested folders
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- manpage
- add more comments to code
- validate for Python 3.10

Planned for next update (The cryptpass Update):

- initial implementation of a data store for other applications (libsecret alt.)
- modularize code in preparation for GUI frontends 

Planned, no timeline:

- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first Linux phones, maybe Android at a later date - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add Windows support and package for more Linux distributions, such as Alpine and Debian)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
