rpass-2021.09.15.mr4

The Housekeeping Update (Pt. 1) - Fourth main release of rpass

This release focuses primarily on polishing rpass and tying up loose ends before
making any major changes in the future.

New features:

- added clipboard support for copying entry information
- many common errors are now handled with proper exceptions
- offline support (sync no longer needs to be configured for rpass to function)

Changes:

- fixed gpg decryption warnings
- added version info argument
- re-ordered config wizard to make more sense
- entry deletion can now be done client-side
- removed rsyncup/rsyncdown/username/ip/port/directoryssh files,
    ^ replaced with one file that holds usernamessh, ip, port, directoryssh, and devicetype
- files should no longer be left in /dev/shm when an error is encountered
- fixed issues relating to using a non-default entry directory
- lots of optimizations have been made to reduce the size of rpass

Planned for next update (The Housekeeping Update Pt. 2):

- a clean, colorful entry list w/o file extensions
- manpage
- multi-line notes
- commented the code
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- improve exceptions for unknown arguments

Planned, no timeline:

- possible libsecret integration
- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first Linux phones, maybe Android at a later date - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add Windows support and package for more Linux distributions)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)

rpass 2021.09.07.pr3.1

The Sync and Foundations Update - Hotfix

Changes:

- gpg configuration now prompts for expiration, rather than defaulting to two years
- rsync is now configured to not delete anything from any remote device when uploading
    ^ this behavior may be modified in the future - this is a quick fix to prevent data loss

rpass 2021.09.07.pr3

The Sync and Foundations Update - Third public release of rpass.

- get rid of gpg decryption warnings
- proper error messages using 'except'
- add exceptions for unknown arguments
- cleanup file list by exporting to document and removing .gpg, adding color
- add a manpage
- allow notes to be multiple lines long (break lines after so many characters)
- validate for Python 3.10
- properly comment the code

Planned, no timeline:

- allow to function as alternative to gnome keyring (libsecret integration)
- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first linux phones, maybe android at a later date - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add windows support and package for more Linux distributions)
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
