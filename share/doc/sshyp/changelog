sshyp 2022.02.16.fr4.4

The High-Tech Shears Update - Patch 4

This release automatically generates user-created folders on new client devices.

Note: Upgrading to releases in the fr4 series requires the configuration ("sshyp tweak") to be re-done, as a device name now must be set (for multi-client deletion). Even upgrading from fr4.3 to fr4.4 will require re-running "sshyp tweak" due to file name changes.

Features:

- implemented proper folder syncing for new clients and clients missing folders that exist server-side

Changes:

- old device names are now automatically deleted (locally) when running "sshyp tweak", to prevent conflicts

&&

Planned for next major update (fr5, The sshyp Doing a Split Update):

sshyp:
** sshyp has recieved a major visual overhaul
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art

sshync:
** sshync has been split into a separate package and now has standalone functionality as a backup/syncing utility
    ^ more details will be available in the sshync repo, once it is created

&&

Planned for next, next major update (fr6, The Farmer Shearing the sshyp Update):

** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected (in sshyp)
** imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
** enforce permissions on the server-side
** allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
** ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions

&&

Backlog:

** create separate gui frontend targetting mobile and desktop Linux
** auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
