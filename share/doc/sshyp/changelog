sshyp 2022.01.13.fr3

The Boxing Update

This release adapts sshyp to be compatible with Termux and allows for packaging for various distributions in addition to Arch Linux.

Features:

- the copy function now has support for termux-clipboard-set from termux-api
    ^ this allows clipboard functionality to work on Termux

Changes:

- sshyp no longer writes to/reads from /var
    ^ configuration files are now stored under the user's home directory in ~/.config/sshyp
    ^ this change allows for compatibility with less standard environments, such as Termux on Android

Additions planned for minor releases:

** updated the manpage with more information regarding how sshyp works and how to set it up
** ensured that it is now impossible for ghosts of entires to remain in /dev/shm
** reduced total lines of code with small optimizations

&&

Planned for next major update (fr4, The sshyp Doing a Split Update):

sshyp:
** sshyp has recieved a major visual overhaul
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art

sshync:
** sshync has been split into a separate package and now has standalone functionality as a backup/syncing utility
    ^ more details will be available in the sshync repo, once it is created

&&

Planned for next, next major update (fr5, The Farmer Shearing the sshyp Update):

** allow for multi-client deletion... somehow (in sshync)
** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected (in sshyp)
** imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
** enforce permissions on the server-side
** allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
** ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions

&&

Backlog:

** create separate gui frontend targetting mobile and desktop Linux
** auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
