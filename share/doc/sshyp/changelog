sshyp v1.4.2
04/30/2023

the argumentative agronomist update - patch two

IMPORTANT: the next major release of sshyp, v1.5.0, will make breaking changes that will require
running through 'sshyp tweak' again - also starting with v1.5.0, a copy of the changelog will no
longer be packaged with sshyp (it will still be available on GitHub) and clipboard tools
(x-clip and wl-clipboard) will be set to optional dependencies ('sshyp tweak' will warn of this)

this release makes use of a new ports framework to make sshyp even smaller and faster than before

user-facing features:

- full WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) support
- partial MacOS support
    ^ fully functional; packaging support has not yet been added
- dedicated help screen for 'gen'
    ^ this was previously not included due to 'sshyp gen' being a valid command prior to v1.4.0
- removed interactive input for whitelist management
    ^ this is to be consistent with the removal of interactive input on clients in v1.4.0

fixes/optimizations:

- leading and following spaces are no longer stripped when printing entry contents
- properly display an error when trying to remove a device from the whitelist that is not whitelisted
- ports framework to remove unneeded code for each platform
    ^ BLANKS.py removes all blank lines
    ^ CLIPBOARD.py removes non-platform-critical clipboard code
    ^ COMMENTS.py removes all comments
    ^ RMSERVER.py removes server-only code for creating client-only packages
        ^ the Haiku package, which was already unsupported as a server, now only includes client code
    ^ SHEBANG.sh sets the shebang to what is required by the platform
    ^ TABS.sh converts all groups of spaces to tabs for space efficiency
    ^ UNAME.py removes all instances of platform detection and leaves only the platform-required code
    ^ THESE SCRIPTS ARE ONLY USED FOR PACKAGING AND DO NOT AFFECT THE SOURCE FILES IN THE GIT REPO
