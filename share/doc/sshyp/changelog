sshyp 2022.01.16.fr3.1

The Boxing Update

This release is a hotfix for 2022.01.13.fr3. It fixes sshync/syncing support after the changes in the last release.

Changes:

- sshync has been updated to work with the new config directory
- sshync now uses its own directory to store the database file
    ^ this is preperation for separating sshync into its own package
- expanduser lines in sshyp have been simplified (no user-facing impact)

Additions planned for minor releases:

** updated the manpage with more information regarding how sshyp works and how to set it up
** ensured that it is now impossible for ghosts of entires to remain in /dev/shm
** reduced total lines of code with small optimizations

&&

Planned for next major update (fr4, The sshyp Doing a Split Update):

sshyp:
** sshyp has recieved a major visual overhaul
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art

sshync:
** sshync has been split into a separate package and now has standalone functionality as a backup/syncing utility
    ^ more details will be available in the sshync repo, once it is created

&&

Planned for next, next major update (fr5, The Farmer Shearing the sshyp Update):

** allow for multi-client deletion... somehow (in sshync)
** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected (in sshyp)
** imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
** enforce permissions on the server-side
** allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
** ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions

&&

Backlog:

** create separate gui frontend targetting mobile and desktop Linux
** auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
