** the gen command in sshyp has been updated to use the newer notetaking system
- printing functions in sshyp have been combined into one function (arguments determine section to print)
** file not found exceptions have been re-implemented
** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected
** folders generated in /dev/shm are once again properly deleted with keyboard interrupts
- .lower() is now used to remove casing when checking inputs
