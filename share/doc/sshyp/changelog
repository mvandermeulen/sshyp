sshyp v1.0

The Polished Trotters Update

This release focuses on overhauling the visual experience and speeding up user interactions with "sshyp".
This release is being crowned "v1.0", as it is considered to be feature-complete.
Future releases will focus on optimizations, bug fixes, and compatibility.

Features:

- majorly overhauled visual experience for sshyp
    ^ this includes a new entry list and **thematic text art
- entries can now optionally be passed as arguments, directly
    ^ as opposed to the user being prompted for an entry name after running a command

Changes:

- corrected outdated liscensing and copyright information
- 'if __name__=="__main__":' convention is now used
- help screens have been overhauled
** improved password generator to guarantee more secure results
- fixed errors when trying to sync with a multi-word entry on the server
- (openssh >= 9.0) sshync now uses 'scp' (via the sftp protocal), rather than 'sftp'
    ^ may cause compatibility issues on non-rolling distros that do not yet have openssh >= 9.0 in the official repos
        ^ in these cases, use sshyp fr4.7 until openssh >= 9.0 is available to you
