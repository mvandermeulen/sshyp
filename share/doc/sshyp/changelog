The Boxing Update - Patch 4

This release is a hotfix for 2022.01.17.fr3.3. It fixes a major bug with sshync.

Changes:

- sshync now correctly uses the auto-generated SSH key in all operations
- an exception has been added for attempting to delete/shear a file that does not exist
- the manpage has been updated and now includes setup instructions

&&

Planned for next major update (fr4, The sshyp Doing a Split Update):

sshyp:
** sshyp has recieved a major visual overhaul
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art

sshync:
** sshync has been split into a separate package and now has standalone functionality as a backup/syncing utility
    ^ more details will be available in the sshync repo, once it is created

&&

Planned for next, next major update (fr5, The Farmer Shearing the sshyp Update):

** allow for multi-client deletion... somehow (in sshync)
** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected (in sshyp)
** imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
** enforce permissions on the server-side
** allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
** ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions

Backlog:
