sshyp 2022.02.16.fr4

The High-Tech Shears Update

This release adds in a major feature: multi-client deletion (details below)

Note: This release requires the configuration ("sshyp tweak") to be re-done, as a device name now must be set (for multi-client deletion).

Features:

- added multi-client deletion
    ^ this means that when an entry is deleted from one client (and thus the server), if another client that has a copy of the deleted entry tries to sync, instead of re-uploading the deleted entry, it will now also have its entry deleted.
    ^ the current implementation requires a new Python script in addition to sshyp and sshync

Changes:

- fixed an issue where sshyp would use the wrong SSH key when trying to delete entries from or create folders on the server
    ^ this is a fix that was recently applied to sshync - turns out I made the same mistake in sshyp
- deleting folders should now work properly with "sshyp shear" if the directory is entered with a following "/"

&&

Planned for next major update (fr5, The sshyp Doing a Split Update):

sshyp:
** sshyp has recieved a major visual overhaul
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art

sshync:
** sshync has been split into a separate package and now has standalone functionality as a backup/syncing utility
    ^ more details will be available in the sshync repo, once it is created

&&

Planned for next, next major update (fr6, The Farmer Shearing the sshyp Update):

** when syncing, a check is made to see if any folders are not on all devices - if the check comes back true, it is corrected (in sshyp)
** imporove password generator to guarantee more secure results
** enforce permissions on the server-side
** allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
** ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions

&&

Backlog:

** create separate gui frontend targetting mobile and desktop Linux
** auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
