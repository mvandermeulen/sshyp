sshyp 2021.11.01.fr1

First public release of sshyp.

This release fixes major bugs from rpass and rebrands the project.

New features:

- an entirely new syncing back-end called sshync (custom Python wrapper around sftp)
    ^ in thoery, all syncing-related data loss should now be fixed, however, this new
    system has just been created and is still under testing. Maybe wait for a few patches
    before trusting this system.

Changes:

- branding has been updated to reflect new project name and goals
- custom directories, custom ssh keys, and offline only mode are removed (may be temporary)
- server installation makes copy of sshync.py in home directory

Bugs to fix!!::
*error when syncing with no files in remote directory
*config warning not disappearing when using server config
*directory not generating with server config

Planned for next update (The Fluffy Update):

- modularized and optimized code
    ^ some older, bad code from "rpass" will be re-written.
- new visual features
    ^ this includes the new file list and thematic text art. sshyp will be
    getting a retro computing theme.
- packages for more environments
    ^ "sshyp" will be officially packaged for Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, and Termux (Android).
    Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora packaging will come later.

Planned for next update (The Sheep w/Shears Update):

- allow for copying entire notes (not just first line)
- allow for multi-client deletion... somehow
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- detatch sshync and make it a separate package
- manpage

Planned, no timeline:

- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first Android + Linux phones - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add Windows support and package for more Linux distributions, such as Debian and Fedora)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
